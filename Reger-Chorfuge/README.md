Transcription of Max Reger's [Chorfuge](http://imslp.org/wiki/Chorfuge_(Reger,_Max)) for four brass instruments. 

This project can generate score and parts for any of the following instrumentations:
* 2 trumpets, horn, trombone (TTHT)
* Trumpet, horn, trombone, tuba (THTT)
* 2 trumpets, trombone, tuba (TTTT)

The targets in the makefile use the abbreviations shown above. So, for example, to generate
score and parts for the TTHT instrumentation execute the following command:

`make ttht`

The original version is in Db major but this arrangement transposes to C major, mainly to make the first trumpet part a bit more relaxing.
