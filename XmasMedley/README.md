Medley for brass quartet of four sacred Christmas songs:
* O Come, All Ye Faithful
* The First Noel
* God Rest You Merry, Gentleman
* Hark! The Herald Angels Sing

This is a straight transcription of SATB parts from a church hymnal.

The makefile is currently set up to generate score and parts for trumpet, horn, trombone, and tuba, but other combinations can be easily generated.

Note, Lilypond complains bitterly about the partial bars internal to the piece, but at least as of version 2.18.2 it sets up the barlines correctly for the pick-up bars.
